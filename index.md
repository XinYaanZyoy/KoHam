Apologize for wasting your time, but i'm still working on this project like since summer 2018!

Kindly visit again at the end of 2028! (i literally thought i could finish this at the end of 2020! how insane i am?)

> THANK YOU FOR VISITING THIS ISLE! :)

# THE AIM
## i wish to build an encyclopedic web; nodes of which are various perpectives, interpretations, though processes, structural and logical theories of existence, and what not?, but one important theme of these nodes is **DEDUCTION FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES**, i'd like to first make some non-rigorous observations put them in whatever form i can, then try to bring a structure of it by finding a root of it, the root here might be a first principle, from these various set of first principles, i'd like to create some nodes with a defined structure on it in terms of laws and constraints, then all these variety of nodes should be classed in an equivalance classes, each these equivalance classes would posses some relations which might be so sort of uderlying second-fundamental causes of this existence, the network of these equivalance classes might lead us to an aspect of the most fundamental cause of this existence, though i still doubt if we can even reach to the first-fundamental cause of this existence, if we ever did i thin not even in knowledge but also in an existential way, it's a BIG PARADOX, an Existential Paradox, if my thoughts gets any sharper and cleaner, i'd write an entry on my journal, but till then...

> I'M IN A SEARCH OF FIRST PRINCIPLES WHICH I CAN LIST DOWN ON A PAGE TO BUILD UP ALL THESE STRUCTURES, I'M STILL OBSERVING AND EXPLORING!


# Updates

- _20H24_: it's a big dream, i'd like to (in the middle of observation and exploration) start by mathematics, then physics, chemistry, biology, psychology and neurobiology, computer science, metaphysics, etc.... but first, MATHEMATICS! let's see when "time" gives me "time" to have "time" to spend some "time" on understanding this "time"!
